# Instructions for ATDD exercises 

## The legacy code
The legacy code is a simple number converter. At the beginning you'll find some converters 
for decimals, binaries and hexadecimals. 

### Tests
The ATDD part is based on cucumber (https://cucumber.io/). The tests are divided in
- feature files
- a JUnit runner i.e. NumberConverterTest.java
- step files

You can execute the test by running the JUnit runner in your IDE.

## Exercises
Each exercise is available in a different branch. Checkout the branch and look in the README.md for the instructions. Start with the branch "exercise_1".
